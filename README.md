This is my first python application, so excuse the syntax butchering. Its pretty self explanatory. Run the python file and enter your steam profile username, it will crawl your page for the games you own and dump the Grid View Images accordingly. 


If you need a compiled version for whatever reason, get it here: http://codeusa.net/demos/SteamGridCompiled.rar
